Jasmine (JavaScript Unit Testing)
=================================

Using Jasmine with node. 
The Jasmine node package contains helper code for developing and running Jasmine tests for node-based projects.


## Initial setup

   - Assumptions: install nodejs (it comes with npm package manager)
   - Install these dependencies: yeoman, and generator-jasmine globally


### Get-Started

   - Run "yo jasmine" in the same root folder of your source files eg. weatherApplication/js
   - To avoid naming conflicts within the project, rename the generated "test" folder as follows: 
		test/index.html -> js-test/SpecRunner.html, but leave the spec/ folder intact.
   - Now, launch "SpecRunner.html" to confirm that jasmine is successful.
   - Add the project source (*.js) and test (*Spec.js) files to the SpecRunner 
   - To see the project tests, run https://localhost:9999/weatherApplication/js/jstest/jasmine/SpecRunner.html
